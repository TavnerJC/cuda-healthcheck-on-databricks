# CI/CD Workflow Fix - Summary

## 🔴 Problem Identified

All GitHub Actions workflows were failing with red X icons despite code passing local validation.

**Root Cause**: Workflows referenced `working-directory: cuda-healthcheck` but files are at repository root.

### Error Pattern:
```yaml
# ❌ INCORRECT (caused failures)
- name: Run tests
  working-directory: cuda-healthcheck
  run: pytest tests/
```

GitHub Actions was looking for `cuda-healthcheck/cuda-healthcheck/src/` instead of `cuda-healthcheck/src/`.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Commit: `9e4d8c2`
**Title**: fix(ci): Remove incorrect working-directory paths from workflows

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed all `working-directory: cuda-healthcheck` lines** from 6 workflow files:
   - `.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/cuda-compatibility-tests.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/release.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/test.yml`

2. **Fixed requirements.txt paths**:
   - Before: `pip install -r cuda-healthcheck/requirements.txt`
   - After: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Fixed README path checks**:
   - Before: `test -f cuda-healthcheck/README.md`
   - After: `test -f README.md`

## 🔍 Verification

### Before Fix:
- ❌ All Code Quality checks failing
- ❌ All Test runs failing
- ❌ All PR checks failing
- ❌ CUDA compatibility tests failing

### After Fix (Expected):
- ✅ Code Quality checks should pass
- ✅ Test runs should pass
- ✅ PR checks should pass
- ✅ CUDA compatibility tests should pass

## 📝 Why This Happened

### Repository Structure:
```
GitHub Repository: TavnerJC/cuda-healthcheck-on-databricks/
├── src/                    ← Files are at root
├── tests/
├── requirements.txt
└── .github/workflows/
```

### What Workflows Were Looking For:
```
GitHub Repository: TavnerJC/cuda-healthcheck-on-databricks/
└── cuda-healthcheck/       ← They expected this subdirectory
    ├── src/
    ├── tests/
    └── requirements.txt
```

### Why It Happened:
When you pushed from the local `cuda-healthcheck/` directory, Git pushed the **contents** of that directory to the repository root, not the directory itself. This is standard Git behavior.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Monitor GitHub Actions (2-3 minutes)

Go to: https://github.com/TavnerJC/cuda-healthcheck-on-databricks/actions

You should see a new workflow run triggered by commit `9e4d8c2` with:
- ✅ Code Quality - PASSING
- ✅ Tests - PASSING
- ✅ PR Checks - PASSING (for any open PRs)

### 2. Dependabot PRs Will Auto-Fix

The 5 Dependabot PRs will automatically get re-tested with the fixed workflows:
- PR #1: actions/upload-artifact (4→6)
- PR #2: actions/checkout (4→6)
- PR #3: softprops/action-gh-release (1→2)
- PR #4: codecov/codecov-action (4→5)
- PR #5: actions/labeler (5→6)

All should now pass their checks ✅

### 3. Merge Dependabot PRs

Once checks pass (green checkmarks):
```bash
# Merge all at once
gh pr merge 1 2 3 4 5 --merge --delete-branch

# Or via GitHub UI:
# https://github.com/TavnerJC/cuda-healthcheck-on-databricks/pulls
```

## 📖 Lessons Learned

### 1. Local vs GitHub Repository Structure
- **Local**: Full path includes project folder name
- **GitHub**: Repository root = contents of pushed directory
- **Workflows**: Should reference paths relative to repository root

### 2. Testing Workflows Locally
Use `act` to test GitHub Actions locally:
```bash
# Install act: https://github.com/nektos/act
choco install act-cli

# Run workflow locally
act -W .github/workflows/code-quality.yml
```

### 3. Common Workflow Patterns

#### ✅ CORRECT Pattern:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: pytest tests/
```

#### ❌ INCORRECT Pattern (for this repo):
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: pip install -r cuda-healthcheck/requirements.txt  # Wrong path
      - working-directory: cuda-healthcheck  # Unnecessary
        run: pytest tests/
```

## 📞 If Issues Persist

### Check Workflow Logs:
1. Go to: https://github.com/TavnerJC/cuda-healthcheck-on-databricks/actions
2. Click on the failing workflow run
3. Click on the failing job
4. Review the error messages

### Common Issues:
- **Missing dependencies**: Add to `requirements.txt`
- **Import errors**: Check module paths in `src/`
- **Test failures**: Run `pytest tests/ -v` locally first
