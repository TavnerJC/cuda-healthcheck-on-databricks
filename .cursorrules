You are helping build a CUDA Healthcheck Tool for Databricks.

## Project Goal
Detect CUDA version incompatibilities between developer environments and Databricks clusters before they cause production failures.

## Technology Stack
- Language: Python 3.10+
- Execution Context: Databricks clusters (GPU-enabled)
- Integration: Databricks Connect (local dev)
- Web UI: Flask/FastAPI for Databricks web interface
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions + CodeRabbit for code reviews
- Infrastructure: Databricks Unity Catalog, custom containers

## Key Patterns
- All CUDA detection uses: nvidia-smi, nvcc, torch.cuda, tensorflow checks
- All code must work in Databricks clusters (no local storage APIs)
- Database: Maintain CUDA breaking change logs in Delta tables
- Dependency management: Use Renovate for automated version tracking

## Code Organization
- src/cuda_detector/ - Core detection logic
- src/healthcheck/ - Health check orchestration
- src/databricks_api/ - Databricks integration
- tests/ - Unit tests using pytest
- .github/workflows/ - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- docs/ - Migration guides, deprecation logs

## Development Workflow
1. Develop locally with Databricks Connect to test on actual clusters
2. Use CodeRabbit for automated PR reviews
3. GitHub Actions runs compatibility tests on CUDA 12.4, 12.6, 13.0
4. All code must be tested against 3+ CUDA versions
